# project_nasa_space
We created an educational website for children that explains space weather in a fun way, using stories and kid-friendly images to make complex space phenomena easier to understand.

NASA Project: Stellar Stories
This is a space-themed front-end web project, developed to present "stellar stories" in an interactive and visually pleasing way. The page uses standard web technologies to create an immersive user experience.

About the Project
The main objective is to display content related to NASA and space, combining an HTML structure, styling with CSS, and interactivity with JavaScript to tell narratives or present facts about the universe.

Technologies Used
The project was built using the following technologies:

HTML5: For the structure and content of the web page.

CSS3: For styling, layout, and responsive design.

JavaScript: To add interactivity, animations, and dynamic functionalities to the page.

File Structure
The project is organized as follows:

Projeto NASA/
│
├── historias_estelares_final.html  # Main page file
├── style_css_final.css             # Main stylesheet
│
├── historias_estelares.js          # Script for the "stories" logic
├── Faiska.html                     # Secondary component or page
└── Faiska.js                       # Script related to the "Faiska" component
historias_estelares_final.html: This is the main entry file that should be opened in the browser. It contains the entire structure of the page.

style_css_final.css: Contains all the styling code, including colors, fonts, layouts, and animations.

historias_estelares.js: The main JavaScript file that manages the interactivity and dynamic content of the page.

Faiska.html and Faiska.js: These appear to be files for a separate component or feature, possibly for a visual effect or animation (like "sparks" or particles).
